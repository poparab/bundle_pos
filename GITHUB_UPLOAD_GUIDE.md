## Automatic Upload Instructions

Since you have your Git credentials configured (username: poparab, email: abdelrahmanmamdouh1996@gmail.com), here are the exact commands to upload your bundle_pos app to GitHub:

### Step 1: Create Repository on GitHub (Web Interface)
1. Go to https://github.com/new
2. Repository name: `bundle_pos`
3. Description: `Dynamic Bundle Point of Sale System for ERPNext`
4. Set to Public
5. **DO NOT** initialize with README, .gitignore, or license (we already have these)
6. Click "Create repository"

### Step 2: Upload via Command Line

Run these commands in your terminal:

```bash
# Navigate to the app directory
cd /workspace/development/frappe-bench/apps/bundle_pos

# Check current status
git status

# Add remote origin
git remote add origin https://github.com/poparab/bundle_pos.git

# Set main branch
git branch -M main

# Push to GitHub
git push -u origin main
```

### Step 3: Verify Upload

- Confirm all files are uploaded correctly

## Alternative: Using GitHub CLI (if available)

If you have GitHub CLI installed:

```bash
cd /workspace/development/frappe-bench/apps/bundle_pos
gh repo create bundle_pos --public --description "Dynamic Bundle Point of Sale System for ERPNext" --source=. --remote=origin --push
```

## What's Being Uploaded

Your repository includes:
- âœ… README.md - Project documentation
- âœ… FEATURES_ROADMAP.md - Development roadmap
- âœ… setup.py - App installation configuration
- âœ… requirements.txt - Python dependencies
- âœ… license.txt - MIT license
- âœ… .gitignore - Git ignore rules
- âœ… MANIFEST.in - Package manifest
- âœ… bundle_pos/ - Main app directory with hooks.py and __init__.py

## After Upload

Once uploaded, you can install the app on any ERPNext site:

```bash
# Get the app from GitHub
bench get-app https://github.com/poparab/bundle_pos.git

# Install on a site
bench --site [your-site-name] install-app bundle_pos
```

## Troubleshooting

If you encounter authentication issues:
1. Make sure you're logged into GitHub
2. You may need to use a Personal Access Token instead of password
3. Or set up SSH keys for authentication

## Next Steps After Upload

1. Start implementing DocTypes according to the FEATURES_ROADMAP.md
2. Create the POS Bundle DocType
3. Implement the bundle selection logic
4. Build the custom POS interface

Your app is ready for development! ðŸš€
